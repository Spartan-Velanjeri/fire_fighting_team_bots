A Drone and Wheeled Robot Duo for search operation in a fire fighting op


This project uses a Hector Quadcopter and Husky AMR for the search operation. The scenario is that there are many buildings and the drone keeps flying around, 
closely watching for a fire. As soon as a fire starts (represented by an Orange tile), the drone sends the coordinates (2D) of the fire and returns back to the
ground station. As soon as this happens the AMR is dispatched from the ground station to the location.

Currently busy with work, I will organise this repo in a few days. 

So for now, I will put the Google Drive link for the project here (Also includes some videos of the working)


More info about the project, do send me a mail @ parthanvelanjeri@hotmail.com
